The python environment should already been set up, please let us know if you ran into issues!

## Colab: To run the colab, enable your python virtual environment 

1. Enter the CSE547-Accessible home directory
2. Run the following command

```
. venv/bin/activate
cd colab
cd colab-0  # this is the first colab that is a tutorial on Spark framework
```

3. Inside each colab directory, there is a `data` folder with all the necessary data file; 
there is also a log folder that contains important outputs that would exist in standard output 

## Homework

1. The homework involves coding and write-ups. In the case of coding, you can write your own code locally and submit the final script in the sub-question field. For example, there is a `q1` folder under `homework/homework-1`.

2. In the case of write-ups, you can just type your answers in the homework latex file. For example, there is a "\/Solution{}" command under `homework/homework-1/handout/association_rules`, which is the second question in homework 1.
