# Q1 Information and Honor Code (0 Points)
Grading comment:
In this assignment, you complete the Colab 2 Notebook and obtain results from it. Your answer would be an integer, a float number, or a string. The float value should be a decimal number rounded to the nearest 0.001. For example, 0.2435 would become 0.244. The string should be all lowercase, no quote or bracket, but may contain spaces or comma. For example, '[Organic Garlic, Limes]' would become organic garlic, limes. 

You can submit as many times as you want, and the last submission will be graded. You do not have to submit your code. Please verify that you have read the above instructions and the Honor Code and that you have not given or received unpermitted aid while completing this assignment.

If you have any questions about how the Honor Code applies to Colab assignments or other parts of the course, please contact the teaching staff for clarification.
