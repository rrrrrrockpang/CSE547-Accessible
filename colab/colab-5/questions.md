# Q1 Information and Honor Code (0 Points)
In this assignment, you complete the Colab3 notebook and obtain results from it. Your answer would be an integer, or a float number. The float value should be a decimal number rounded to the nearest 0.001. For example, 0.2435 would become 0.244. 

You can submit as many times as you want, and the last submission will be graded. No late day is allowed for any Colab assignment. 

Please verify that you have read the above instructions and the Honor Code and that you have not given or received unpermitted aid while completing this assignment.

If you have any questions about how the Honor Code applies to Colab assignments or other parts of the course, please contact the teaching staff for clarification.

# Q2 Weakly connected component (2 Points)
Using NetworkX, you analyze the web-Stanford graph, and obtain the largest weakly connected component (WCC).

## Q2.1 (1 Point)

How many nodes are present in the largest WCC? (Integer)

Answer: 

## Q2.2 (1 Point)

What is the average out-degree of the largest WCC? (Float)

Answer:

# Q3 Graph generation (4 Points)

Next, you approximate the web-Stanford graph with either a random graph, or a Barabasi-Albert graph as instructed in the notebook.

## Q3.1 Edges in random graph (1 Point)

How many edges are present in the generated random graph? (Integer)

Answer:

## Q3.2 Node id with maximal PR (1 Point)

Next, calculate the PageRank (PR) values for the random graph. Which node has the largest PageRank value? (Integer)

Answer:

## Q3.3 Edges in Barab치si-Albert graph (1 Point)

How many edges are present in the generated Barab치si-Albert graph? (Integer)

Answer:

## Q3.4 Max value of PR (1 Point)

You then calculate the PageRank (PR) values for the Barab치si-Albert graph. What is range of the largest PageRank value?

A: (10^{-6}, 10^{-5})
B: (10^{-5}, 10^{-4})
C: (10^{-4}, 10^{-3})
D: (10^{-3}, 10^{-2})
E: (10^{-2}, 10^{-1})

# Q4 Cosine similarity (2 Points)
Finally, you calculate the cosine similarity between the sorted PageRank-value vectors.

## Q4.11 Point

What is the cosine similarity between the web-Stanford graph and the random generated graph? (Float)
Answer: 

## Q4.21 Point
