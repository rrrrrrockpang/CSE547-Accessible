# Q1 Information and Honor Code (0 Points)
In this assignment, you complete the Colab3 notebook and obtain results from it. Your answer would be an integer, or a float number. The float value should be a decimal number rounded to the nearest 0.001. For example, 0.2435 would become 0.244. 

You can submit as many times as you want, and the last submission will be graded. No late day is allowed for any Colab assignment. 

Please verify that you have read the above instructions and the Honor Code and that you have not given or received unpermitted aid while completing this assignment.

If you have any questions about how the Honor Code applies to Colab assignments or other parts of the course, please contact the teaching staff for clarification.

# Q2 Barbell graph 0 Node Path (2 Points)
Generate a barbell graph with no internal nodes, where each complete graph has exactly 1000 nodes.

## Q2.1 Number of nodes (1 Point)

How many nodes are present in the generated graph? (Integer)

Answer: 

## Q2.2 Number of edges (1 Point)

How many edges are present in the generated graph? (Integer)

Answer: 

# Q3 Barbell graph with 50 Node Path (2 Points)
Generate a barbell graph with a path of 50 internal nodes between the two complete graphs, where each complete graph has exactly 1000 nodes.

## Q3.1 Number of nodes (1 Point)

How many nodes are present in the generated graph? (Integer)

Answer: 

## Q3.2 Number of edges (1 Point)

How many edges are present in the generated graph? (Integer)

Answer: 

## Q4 Node2Vec embeddings (3 Points)
You embed nodes with node2vec embeddings on each generated graph, setting p = 1, q = 1 and d = 10. 

In each graph, you compare the cosine similarity of each nodes to all the nodes (including itself) in that graph. 

Moreover, we define two nodes as "neighbors" if their cosine similarity is > 0.8.

## Q4.11 Point

How many nodes have exactly 1000 "neighbors" (including itself) in the "Barbell Graph 0 Node path"?

Answer: 

## Q4.21 Point

How many nodes have exactly 1000 "neighbors" (including itself) in the "Barbell Graph with 50 Node Path"?

Answer: 

Q4.31 Point

How many nodes have less than 100 "neighbors" (including itself) in the "Barbell Graph with 50 Node Path"?
