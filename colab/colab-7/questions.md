# Q1 Information and Honor Code (0 Points)
In this assignment, you complete the Colab3 notebook and obtain results from it. Your answer would be an integer, or a float number. The float value should be a decimal number rounded to the nearest 0.001. For example, 0.2435 would become 0.244. 

You can submit as many times as you want, and the last submission will be graded. No late day is allowed for any Colab assignment. 

Please verify that you have read the above instructions and the Honor Code and that you have not given or received unpermitted aid while completing this assignment.

If you have any questions about how the Honor Code applies to Colab assignments or other parts of the course, please contact the teaching staff for clarification.
