\textbf{Academic Integrity} We take \href{https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct}{academic integrity} extremely seriously. 
We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions and the code independently. In addition, each student should write down the set of people whom they interacted with.
