<p><strong>Assignment Submission</strong> All students should submit
their assignments electronically via GradeScope. No handwritten work
will be accepted. Math formulas must be typeset using LATEX or other
word processing software that supports mathematical symbols (E.g. Google
Docs, Microsoft Word). Simply sign up on Gradescope and use the course
code V84RPB. Please use your UW NetID if possible.</p>
<p>For the non-coding component of the homework, you should upload a PDF
rather than submitting as images. We will use Gradescope for the
submission of code as well. Please make sure to tag each part correctly
on Gradescope so it is easier for us to grade. There will be a small
point deduction for each mistagged page and for each question that
includes code. Put all the code for a single question into a single file
and upload it. Only files in text format (e.g. .txt, .py, .java) will be
accepted. <strong>There will be no credit for coding questions without
submitted code on Gradescope, or for submitting it after the
deadline</strong>, so please remember to submit your code.</p>
<p><strong>Coding</strong> You may use any programming languages and
standard libraries, such as NumPy and PySpark, but you may not use
specialized packages and, in particular, machine learning libraries
(e.g. sklearn, TensorFlow), unless stated otherwise. Ask on the
discussion board whether specific libraries are allowed if you are
unsure.</p>
<p><strong>Late Day Policy</strong> All students will be given two
no-questions-asked late periods, but only one late period can be used
per homework and cannot be used for project deliverables. A late-period
lasts 48 hours from the original deadline (so if an assignment is due on
Thursday at 11:59 pm, the late period goes to the Saturday at 11:59pm
Pacific Time).</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong> We take <a
href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct">academic
integrity</a> extremely seriously. We strongly encourage students to
form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in
groups. However, each student must write down the solutions and the code
independently. In addition, each student should write down the set of
people whom they interacted with.</p>
<p>Discussion Group (People with whom you discussed ideas used in your
answers):</p>
<p>On-line or hardcopy documents used as part of your answers:</p>
<p>I acknowledge and accept the Academic Integrity clause.</p>
<h1 id="spark-35-pts">Spark (35 pts):</h1>
<p>In this question, you will improve your Spark programming skills and
practice composing an algorithm into map and reduce functions.
Implementing a simple friendship recommendation algorithm using Spark
will also help you with the next assignments and the class project.</p>
<p>Write a Spark program that implements a simple ``People You Might
Know’’ social network friendship recommendation algorithm. The key idea
is that if two people have a lot of mutual friends, then the system
should recommend that they connect with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Associated data file is <code>soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt</code> in
q1/data.</li>
<li>The file contains the adjacency list and has multiple lines in the
following format: <User><TAB><Friends></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <User> is a unique integer ID corresponding to a unique user,
and <Friends> is a comma separated list of unique IDs corresponding to
the friends of the user with the unique ID <User>. Note that the
friendships are mutual (i.e., edges are undirected): if A is friend with
B then B is also friend with A. The data provided is consistent with
that rule as there is an explicit entry for each side of each edge.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>Let us use a simple algorithm such that, for each user U, the
algorithm recommends N = 10 users who are not already friends with U,
but have the most number of mutual friends in common with U.</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The output should contain one line per user in the following
format: <User><TAB><Recommendations>, where <User> is a unique ID
corresponding to a user and <Recommendations> is a comma separated list
of unique IDs corresponding to the algorithm’s recommendation of people
that <User> might know, ordered in decreasing number of mutual
friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if a user has less than 10 second-degree friends, output all
of them in decreasing order of the number of mutual friends. If a user
has no friends, you can provide an empty list of recommendations. If
there are recommended users with the same number of mutual friends, then
output those user IDs in numerically ascending order.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pipeline sketch</strong></p>
<p>Please provide a description of how you used Spark to solve this
problem. Don’t write more than 3 to 4 sentences for this: we only want a
very high-level description of your strategy to tackle this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before submitting a complete application to Spark, you may use the
Shell to go line by line, checking the outputs of each step. Command
.take(X) should be helpful, if you want to check the first X elements in
the RDD.</li>
<li>For sanity check, your top 10 recommendations for user ID 11 should
be: 27552, 7785, 27573, 27574, 27589, 27590, 27600, 27617, 27620,
27667.</li>
<li>The default memory assigned to the Spark runtime may not be enough
to process this data file, depending on how you write your algorithm. If
your Spark job fails with a message starting as:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>17/12/28 10:50:35 INFO DAGScheduler: Job 0 failed: sortByKey at FriendsRecomScala.scala:45, took 519.084974 s
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; org.apache.spark.SparkException:
Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 2.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure:
Lost task 0.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 4, localhost, executor driver)</code></pre>
<p>then you’ll very likely need to increase the memory assigned to the
Spark runtime. If you are running in stand-alone mode (i.e. you did not
setup a Spark cluster), use –driver-memory 8G to set the runtime memory
to 8GB. If you are running on a Spark cluster, use –executor-memory 8G
to set the memory to 8GB.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to submit?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upload your code to Gradescope.</li>
<li>Include in your writeup a short paragraph sketching your spark

<h1 id="association-rules-45-points">Association Rules (45 points)</h1>
<p>This is a math question. You can answer them below.</p>
<p>Association Rules are frequently used for Market Basket Analysis
(MBA) by retailers to understand the purchase behavior of their
customers. This information can be then used for many different purposes
such as cross-selling and up-selling of products, sales promotions,
loyalty programs, store design, discount plans and many others.</p>
<p>In this question, you will investigate the association rules in more
detail which can enable you to select more informative and suitable
rules for various recommendation systems in the future.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-of-item-sets">Evaluation of item sets</h2>
<p>Once you have found the frequent itemsets of a dataset, you need to
choose a subset of them as your recommendations. Commonly used metrics
for measuring significance and interest for selecting rules for
recommendations are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Confidence</strong> (denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{conf}}(A \rightarrow B)\)</span>):
<em>Confidence</em> is defined as the probability of occurrence of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in the basket if the basket already
contains <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathop{\mathrm{conf}}(A \rightarrow B)
= \Pr(B|A),\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(B|A)\)</span> is the
conditional probability of finding item set <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> given that item set <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is present.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Lift</strong> (denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{lift}}(A \rightarrow B)\)</span>):
<em>Lift</em> measures how much more “<span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occur together” than “what would be
expected if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> were statistically independent”:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathop{\mathrm{lift}}(A \rightarrow B)
= \frac{\mathop{\mathrm{conf}}(A \rightarrow B)}{S(B)},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(S(B) =
\frac{\mathop{\mathrm{Support}}(B)}{N}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N=\text{total number of transactions
(baskets)}\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Conviction</strong> (denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}(A \rightarrow B)\)</span>):
<em>Conviction</em> compares the “probability that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> appears without <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> if they were independent” with the
“actual frequency of the appearance of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> without <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”: <span
class="math display">\[\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}(A \rightarrow B) =
\frac{1-S(B)}{1-\mathop{\mathrm{conf}}(A \rightarrow B)}.\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Answer the question here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (a) [4pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>A drawback of using <em>confidence</em> is that it ignores <span
class="math inline">\(\Pr(B)\)</span>. Why is this a drawback? Explain
why <em>lift</em> and <em>conviction</em> do not suffer from this
drawback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (b) [5pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>A measure is <em>symmetrical</em> if <span
class="math inline">\(\text{measure}(A \rightarrow B) = \text{measure}(B
\rightarrow A)\)</span>. Which of the measures presented here are
symmetrical? For each measure, please provide either a proof that the
measure is symmetrical, or a counterexample that shows the measure is
not symmetrical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (c) [6pts]</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Perfect implications</em> are rules that hold 100% of the time
(or equivalently, the associated conditional probability is 1). A
measure is <em>desirable</em> if it reaches its maximum achievable value
for all perfect implications. This makes it easy to identify the best
rules. Which of the above measures have this property? You may ignore
<span class="math inline">\(0/0\)</span> but not other infinity cases.
Also you may find it easy to explain by an example.</p>
<h2 id="application-in-product-recommendations">Application in product
recommendations</h2>
<p>The action or practice of selling additional products or services to
existing customers is called <em>cross-selling</em>. Giving product
recommendation is one of the examples of cross-selling that are
frequently used by online retailers. One simple method to give product
recommendations is to recommend products that are frequently browsed
together by the customers.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to recommend new products to the customer based on
the products they have already browsed online. Implement the
<em>A-priori</em> algorithm and write a program using your
implementation to find products which are frequently browsed together.
Fix the support to <span class="math inline">\(s=100\)</span> (i.e.,
product pairs need to occur together at least 100 times to be considered
frequent) and find itemsets of size 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Use the online browsing behavior dataset from <a
href="abc.org">browsing.txt</a> in <a href="">q2/data</a>. Each line
represents a browsing session of a customer. On each line, each string
of 8 characters represents the ID of an item browsed during that
session. The items are separated by spaces.</p>
<p>Note: for parts (d) and (e), the writeup will require a specific rule
ordering but the program need not sort the output. We are not giving
partial credits to coding when results are wrong. However, three sanity
checks are provided and they should be helpful when you progress: (1)
there are 647 frequent items after <span
class="math inline">\(1^{\textrm{st}}\)</span> pass (<span
class="math inline">\(|L_1|=647\)</span>), (2) there are 1334 frequent
pairs after <span class="math inline">\(2^{\textrm{nd}}\)</span> pass
(<span class="math inline">\(|L_2|=1334\)</span>), (3) the top 5 pairs
you should produce in part (d) all have confidence scores greater than
0.985. See detailed instructions below. You don’t need to use Spark
unless you want to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (d) [15pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify pairs of items <span class="math inline">\((X,Y)\)</span>
such that the support of <span class="math inline">\(\{X,Y\}\)</span> is
at least <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> and list the top 5
pairs with the highest support in the writeup. For all such pairs (the
support of <span class="math inline">\(\{X,Y\}\)</span> is at least
<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>), compute the
<em>confidence</em> scores of the corresponding association rules: <span
class="math inline">\(X \Rightarrow Y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Y \Rightarrow X\)</span>. Sort the rules in
decreasing order of <em>confidence</em> scores and list the top 5 rules
in the writeup. Break ties, if any, by lexicographically increasing
order on the left hand side of the rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (e) [15pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify item triples <span class="math inline">\((X,Y,Z)\)</span>
such that the support of <span class="math inline">\(\{X,Y,Z\}\)</span>
is at least <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> and list the top 5
triples with the highest support in the writeup. For all such triples
(the support of <span class="math inline">\(\{X,Y,Z\}\)</span> is at
least <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>), compute the scores of
the corresponding association rules: <span class="math inline">\((X,Y)
\Rightarrow Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((X,Z) \Rightarrow
Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((Y,Z) \Rightarrow X\)</span>.
Sort the rules in decreasing order of scores and list the top 5 rules in
the writeup. Order the left-hand-side pair lexicographically and break
ties, if any, by lexicographical order of the first then the second item
in the pair.</p>

<h1 id="locality-sensitive-hashing-20-pts">Locality-Sensitive Hashing
(20 pts)</h1>
<p>When simulating a random permutation of rows, as described in
<strong>Sect. 3.3.5</strong> of MMDS, we could save time if we
restricted our attention to a randomly chosen <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rows, rather than hashing all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> row numbers. The downside of doing so
is that, if none of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rows
contains a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in a certain column,
then the result of the minhashing is “don’t know”. In other words, we
get no row number as the minhash value. It would be a mistake to assume
that two columns that both minhash to “don’t know” are likely to be
similar. However, if the probability of getting “don’t know” as a
minhash value is small, we can tolerate the situation and simply ignore
such minhash values when computing the fraction of minhashes in which
two columns agree.</p>
<p>You will try to understand the process of selecting an appropriate
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> value and how it affects the
computation of the minhash. This exercise will highlight the importance
of parameter selection for LSH.</p>
<p>In part (a) we determine an upper bound on the probability of getting
“don’t know” as the minhash value when considering only a <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-subset of the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rows, and in part (b) we use this bound
to determine an appropriate choice for <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, given our tolerance for this
probability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (a) [7pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose a column has <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> 1’s and
therefore <span class="math inline">\(n-m\)</span> 0’s, and we randomly
choose k rows to consider when computing the minhash. Prove that the
probability of getting “don’t know” as the minhash value for this column
is at most <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{n-k}{n}\right)^m\)</span> (Note: m is
the power, not a multiplication).</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (b) [7pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we want the probability of “don’t know” to be at most <span
class="math inline">\(e^{-10}\)</span>. Assuming <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are both very large (but <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is much larger than <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), give a simple approximation to the
smallest value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that will
ensure this probability is at most <span
class="math inline">\(e^{-10}\)</span>. Your expression should be a
function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Hints: (1) Part a. (2) Remember that
for any <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1 + x \le e^x\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question (c) [6pts]</li>
</ul>
<p>In LSH, there are relationships between different similarity metrics
and hash functions. In this question, we will go over an example where
the similarity metric and the hash function do not match.</p>
<p>Note: Part (c) should be considered separate from the previous two
parts, in that we are no longer restricting our attention to a randomly
chosen subset of the rows.</p>
<p>When minhashing, one might expect that we could estimate the Jaccard
similarity without using all possible permutations of rows. For example,
we could only allow cyclic permutations, i.e. start at a randomly chosen
row <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, which becomes the first in
the order, followed by rows <span class="math inline">\(r + 1\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(r + 2\)</span>, and so on, down to the last
row, and then continuing with the first row, second row, and so on, down
to row <span class="math inline">\(r - 1\)</span>. There are only <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such permutations if there are <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rows. However, these permutations are
not sufficient to estimate the Jaccard similarity correctly.</p>
<p>Give an example of two columns such that the probability (over cyclic
permutations only) that their minhash values agree is not the same as
their Jaccard similarity. In your answer, please provide (a) an example
of a matrix with two columns (let the two columns correspond to sets
denoted by <span class="math inline">\(S1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S2\)</span>), (b) the Jaccard similarity of <span
class="math inline">\(S1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S2\)</span>, and (c) the probability that a random
cyclic permutation yields the same minhash value for both <span
class="math inline">\(S1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S2\)</span>.</p>
